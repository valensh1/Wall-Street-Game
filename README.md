## Overview
Compete against another player to see who is the best trader and can reach ONE MILLION DOLLARS in their portfolio first without losing all their money. With each trading day each trader will encounter market forces by random chance that will impact their portfolios along with random life events that will also cause a trader to have to pull money out of their portfolios to pay for such expenses. Each player has the option to pass on their turn in order to hold their positions and hope the other player loses their money first.

4. Click Hedge Positions & Take Day Off button when you want to stop your turn when you fear that the next trading day could be a disaster and set your portfolio back or you may encounter an unlucky health problem. You would want to choose this option when you have a healthy cash balance and hope that the competing player may lose all his money before you.

### The Challenge

This was my first project from my General Assembly coding bootcamp class. The challenge was coming up with an interactive, fun and humerous 2 player game that incorporated one of my passions in life which is the stock market.

### Built With

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- JQuery

### What I Learned

Learned to build a interactive 2 player game utilizing the following:
- Functions
- Math library (Math.random for the random stock market events)
- Switch statements (used for all the different stock market scenarios based on the random number generated)
- Ternary Operators
- Modals (used for game instructions, prompting the user when its their turn or when a player wins game and to display the different gif's based on stock market activity that day)
- Use of JavaScript classes and extending classes to sub-classes
- Working with Objects - creating object classes using object constructor functions
- Working with Arrays
- Event Listeners - used on buttons for when user clicks to trade stocks or to hedge positions.
- DOM Manipulation
- Using JavaScript to change CSS styles such as toggling class names when an event occurs.
    

### Continued Development

Looking forward to continuing to obtain valuable skills through the use of building applications and competing in challenges.
