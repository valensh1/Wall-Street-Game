# APP TITLE:
Wall Street (https://valensh1.github.io/Projects/)

# CONCEPT:
Compete against another player to see who is the best trader and can reach $1M in their portfolio first without losing all their money. With each trading day each trader will encounter market forces by random chance that will impact their portfolios along with random life events that will also cause a trader to have to pull money out of their portfolios to pay for such expenses. Each player has the option to pass on their turn in order to hold their positions and hope the other player loses their money first.
